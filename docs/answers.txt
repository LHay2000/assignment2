$ git rev-list --all --count

I also used $ git shortlog for a break down of commits.
There are 9 commits. 6 by Estaban and 3 by myself.

4. Branches are used in Git repositories to ease the addition and removal of
code. If branches weren't used and code needed to be removed, but new code 
relied on the removed code, it would cause problems. The ability to merge branched
code is also important because accepted code can be implemented in its desired 
location.

5. Git status focuses on the current working directory, while git log looks
at the history of commits in a project.

6. $ git log --all ~/documents/GitHub/assignment2/Vehicle.h
This command shows all commits for Vehicle.h, which there are 3.

7. $ git log --grep=file
This command returns all commit messages containing 'file,' there were also 3 here.

8. Inheritance allows a class to derived from another class. The derived class shares 
attributes and methods from the parent. Polymorphism relates to the inheritance through
the form the data takes. Polymorphism makes sure the objects execute the correct methods.
Encapsulation is often seen in classes where data and methods that are used on the data
are held.

9. The main difference between the "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow and "Integration" 
workflow is the number of phases where merging occurs. In the "Dictator and Lieutenants"
workflow the number of repositories are cut in half until the dictator makes the final 
push. The "Integration" workflow has the same people working on changes until the 
manager makes the push.

10. Changes to the shared repository in the Centralized workflow could make another 
developer's changes obselete. The "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow allows changes
to be made, but they have to be merged and approved first by people that are higher up.
